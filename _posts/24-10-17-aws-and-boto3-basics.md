title: Quick Start with Boto3 and AWS
---


In this post, weâ€™ll take a look at some basics examples of using Python scripts to interact with the infrastructure provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS).

Take in count if you want to replicate this with your own AWS account, you will need:
* An AWS account with admin or power user privileges.
* Internet connection and Linux shell environment.
* Some experience with Python and Bash command line interface.
* An EC2 instance with Python, Boto3 and AWS CLI tool configured. You can use the Amazon Linux AMI which has all these packets.


Next you can update your site name, avatar and other options using the _config.yml file in the root of your repository (shown below).

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
